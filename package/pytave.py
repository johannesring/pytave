	The function is set to return nargout values. Returned values

	M-files are searched for in the Octave path.

	See also the Octave documentation for the builtin Octave function

	Type conversions
	****************
	
	The following type conversions are supported:

	Python to Octave
	================
	
	Objects:
		int (32-bit)        int32
		float (64-bit)      double
		str                 string
		dict                struct
		list                cell
		
	Numeric Array:
		UBYTE, SBYTE,       matrix of correct type
		USHORT, SHORT,      -''-
		UINT, SINT,         -''-
		LONG,               -''-
		DOUBLE              -''-

	All other objects causes a pytave.ObjectConvertError to be
	raised. This exception inherits TypeError.
	
	Octave to Python
	================
	
	Scalar values to objects:
		bool                bool
		real scalar         float (64-bit)
		any string*         str
		struct              dict
		cell*               list

		* Cell arrays must be one-dimensional (row vector) and
                  character matrices must only have one row.  Any
                  other form will raise a ValueConvertError.
		
	Matrix values to Numeric arrays:
		int64               LONG
		int32, uint32       INT, UINT
		int16, uint16       SHORT, USHORT
		int8, unint8        SBYTE, UBYTE

	All other values causes a pytave.ValueConvertError to be
	raised. This exception inherits TypeError.

	Errors
	******

	Octave runtime errors are encapsulated into
	pytave.OctaveError exceptions, base class RuntimeError.
